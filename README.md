# Mathematical-Modeling
Hello! I'm someone who loves playing with numbers and turning real-life situations into math puzzles. 

I've got a background in math, statistics and economics, and have used my skills to create models that mimic how things work in the real world. For instance, I've simulated the interplay between labor market and goods market using Macroeconomics, math and statistics, and figured out ways to optimize factory manufactoring speed line as well as the idle time of the offload workers.

Now, as a digital analyst at the university, I'm diving into the world of optimizing exam schedules. I'm all about using math to solve everyday problems. Whether it's making markets work better or making sure exams run efficiently, I'm your go-to person for turning complex situations into understandable math solutions. Let's make things work better together!

The main tools used here include but not limited to Theory of Operation Research, Algorithm Design, Numerical Mathematics, along with programming Language Python.
